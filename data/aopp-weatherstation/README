Weather station data repository
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two weather stations have been operated on the roof of the Atmospheric Physics Building (51.759316,
-1.255634) from 2001-11 and 2012-present by the Earth Observation Data Group (EODG) within the 
subdepartment of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics (AOPP) of the University of Oxford. The 
observations from that station are freely presented here for any non-commercial use, updated at 9am
each day. Commercial users should first contact EODG (details below). Please cite EODG, 
weatherstationdata.physics.ox.ac.uk and the current operator (details below) when using this data in 
a published study. Otherwise, no specific permission is required for its use. The data is presented 
with no warranty nor guarantee of fitness for a particular purpose. Though the instrumentation was 
provided calibrated by the manufacturer, the quality and consistency of this cannot be guaranteed and 
has not yet been investigated in any substantial manner. Any assistance in this matter would be 
greatly appreciated.

The data is stored as text files, sorted into folders by year. One file is generated for each day,
named MPYYYYMMDD.csv, where MP is a label, YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day. The
files consists of a series of rows, with each row corresponding to a single observation. There is no
header. A row follows the format:
        DD-MM-YYYY, HH:II:SS, WD, WS, TEMP, SUN, RAIN, PRE, HUM, WET
DD =   day of month, 1-31;
MM =   month of year, 1-12;
YYYY = year;
HH =   hour of day, 0-23;
II =   minute of hour, 0-59;
SS =   second of minute, 0-59;
WD =   wind direction, to the nearest degree;
WS =   wind speed, in metres per second to one decimal place;
TEMP = dry bulb temperature, in Celsius to one decimal place;
SUN =  the number of hours of sunshine since the last observation, in hours to two decimal places;
RAIN = rainfall since the last observation, in millimetres to two decimal places;
PRE =  pressure, to the nearest hectopascal;
HUM =  relative humidty observed by a solid-state sensor, in percent;
WET =  wet bulb temperature, in Celsius.

Missing data are indicated by the value -999. Date/time values are printed with fixed width; all
other values have variable width. Though the data file format has been standardised between the two 
stations, there is a subtle difference between the observations:
- 2001-11 observations report the instantaneous wind, temperature, pressure, and humidity observed
  at the recorded time (approximately every four seconds);
- 2012-present observations report the average wind, temperature, pressure, and humidity observed
  over the last ten seconds every ten seconds.

From Sep 2021, a second set of daily files is produced, named UVYYYYMMDD.csv (using the same
convention as above), to summarise the instantaneous observations of a UV spectrophotometre which has
been stationed on the roof since the late 1990s. There is a header that reads:
        date,time,SUV Intensity [MED/Hr],UV Index,Daily total [MED],Since Last [MED]
A row follows the format:
        DD/MM/YYYY,HH:II:SS,SS,SI,UI,DT,SL
SI = Instantaneous UV intensity in units of MED (minimum erythema dose) per hour;
UI = Instantaneous UV index;
DT = Daily total UV radiation in units of MED;
SL = The change in Daily total UV radiation since the last measurement, in units of MED.

In addition, after installation of the current station, it took a few weeks to select an appropriate
mode for operation. Hence, observations from August 2012 vary from 1-60 second averages and should
be used with care.

These data files were produced by the Python script 'update_weather'. The website 
http://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/eodg/weather/weather.html is generated by the perl script 'update_webpage'.
These scripts are maintained in the repository gitlab.physics.ox.ac.uk/povey/aopp_weather_station
and bug reports are readily accepted. Technical details of the current station are summarised at 
http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/group/eodg/weather/station.html. The previous station was very similar.

Any questions, comments, concerns, or recommendations should be directed to the operator.
